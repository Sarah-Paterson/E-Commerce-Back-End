# SVG Logo Creator

## Description

In this project, I worked with existing code provided by The Coding Bootcamp on GitLab, and I worked with javascript to create functionality for an e-commerce back end. I was motivated to finish the code that was provided to add database viewing and editable with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. In order to be assured that the code is working properly, I used Insomnia as shown in the video walkthrough linked below.

This code was created for the purpose of viewing, adding to, and editing a database. It provides the opportunity to organize a back end database that would be on an e-commerce website.

Through the process of finishing the provided code for the e-commerce back end, I was able to learn more about GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. There were many trials and errors to work out when connecting different categories, tags, and products that helped me learn more about api’s and databases.

[Here is a link to the video showing how it is used](https://youtu.be/WZZRXUQBrUY).

## Installation

In order to run this program, the user will have to have node.js installed on their device. Once that is complete, then using *node i* in the terminal will download the necessary applications for the program to run as intended.
Also, the user will need to add their database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file to connect to a database using Sequelize. From there, the user will need to enter schema and seed commands, and a development database is created and is seeded with test data.

## Usage

To use the E-Commerce-Back-End, start with node server.js. From here you can use insomnia to see the change in the database after seeding the dummy information.
